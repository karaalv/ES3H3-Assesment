# ES3H3 Machine Learning Coursework

This repository holds copies of my solutions to a machine learning coursework for the third year module ***Intelligent Systems Design***.

In this coursework I utilised the following techniques: 

### Gradient Descent
- Gradient Descent was utilised to minimise the cost function across various examples. This optimisation technique was essential in linear regression tasks, where it continued to adjust parameters until the cost function reached a minimal threshold.

### Newtonian Descent
- Newtonian Descent was used to optimise multiple cost function examples, offering a faster convergence rate compared to Gradient Descent due to its utilisation of second order derivatives.

### Multivariate Linear Regression
- This technique extended traditional linear regression to multiple features, allowing for more complex modelling of relationships between variables. By utilising matrix algebra, I performed efficient calculations to determine the optimal regression coefficients from several input variables.

### Logistic Regression
- Logistic Regression was applied for binary classification tasks. By incorporating the sigmoid function, linear regression outputs were transformed into probabilities, enabling clear binary decision-making within the dataset.
